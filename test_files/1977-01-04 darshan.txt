1/4/77 darshan

You see the surface only.   (The effect and not the cause?)   Yes.   Yoga makes you see the cause.   You donâ€™t even have to see.   The chitta becomes calm.

(Heat in the head during sadhana.)   Energy rises up very fast.   It happens in emotional people.   Do shitali (pranayama).

Sita is swallowed up by the earth at end of one version of Ramayana.   She was the earth.   God and his creation are one.   It is symbolic.
