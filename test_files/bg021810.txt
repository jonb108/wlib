These are the questions and answers with Baba Hari Dass at the Bhagavad Gita Class at the Pacific Cultural Center on Thursday, February 18, 2010. Mandira read the chalkboard. Reading: Bhagavad Gita II: 25-28 – Samkhya Yoga (Yoga Of Knowledge).


25 - This (Self) is said to be unmanifest, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing this to be such, you should not grieve.
 
Assuming the Self Is Subject to Birth and Death, Still It Is Not Proper to Grieve - 26 & 27
26 - But even if you think of This (Self) as being constantly born and constantly dying, even then, O Mighty Armed (Arjuna), you should not grieve.
27 - For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable you should not grieve.

Birth and Death Are Natural Laws of the Universe - 28
28 - Beings are experienced to be unmanifest in their beginning, are seen to be manifest in their middle state, O Bharata (Arjuna), and are noticed to be unmanifest again in their end. What is there then to grieve about?


Q:	Some of these verses seem harmoniously Buddhist related, when Krishna says to Arjuna that even if you think that the soul is perpetually born and dies and reborn. Reminds me of the old adage that ‘if there’s something to do about it, there’s nothing to worry about. If there’s nothing to do about it, there’s no reason to worry.’ And, first there were no mountains, then there were the mountains, then not. One’s perception of the world leads one to think it is real. Later, with spiritual study and practice, there’s a negation of the world, or disengagement with the allurements of the world. Later on, with greater understanding of the oneness of spirit and nature, that Brahman and prakriti are actually one, and cannot be two, once again there can be a kind of unattached involvement with the world, a natural spontaneous interaction of the world without infatuation or desires. This brings to mind the thesis, antithesis and then synthesis. Adi Shankaracharya says ‘neti, neti.’ Only Brahman is real and the world is not. Later, all is Brahman. One is the antithesis of the initial illusion, and then there is the synthesis.
M:	In the last verse we read, Krishna is moving Arjuna out of the materialist view and back toward the absolutist’s point of view. There may have been a nod to the Buddhist’s view. Everything is changeable, not one soul.
A:	Gross to subtle. Gross is seen, so first we analyze it.
Q:	That’s what Samkhya is based upon, analysis of the 24 elements.

Q:	(missed something)
A:	USA exports!

Q:	How do you perceive it then, if it’s unmanifest to the senses?
A:	We don’t. By your imagination. 
Q:	It’s a miracle that any of us perceive it as best we can. We experience it, and then the scriptures verify it. What’s the miracle that turns it around and creates the experience?
A:	We experience.
M:	Is it true that we experience a little glimpse now and then?
A:	(Nods yes.)

Q:	The proof of the presence of spirit here and now is the livingness and the awareness that’s happening in every single instrument that’s here now. It can’t be seen as a separate object; the proof is the seeing, not the seen. The feeling, the living. The tendency of the conditioned mind is to look for an object. It’s the perceiving, the aware-ing. 

Q:	The soul and the Self are one and the same?
A:	Yes.
Q:	What is the indeclinable ‘I’?
M:	(explains) It’s a part of speech that doesn’t change its form.

Q:	Is there something within us that recognizes the divine presence somehow?
A:	If you taste ocean water, you infer it will be the same everywhere.
M:	In Vedanta, they use the term Self-realization, the Self finds itself.
A:	Self has several meanings.
Q:	As the mind is more purified, then maybe mahat discriminates between what is eternal and what is finite?
A:	Yes. Everything is eternal in its pure state.

Q:	It’s like you can’t see your own face, yet you know it’s there.
M:	I don’t mind it because I’m behind it.
A:	In the mirror, you can.
Q:	So the mirror is like pure consciousness?
A:	That’s how Self is realized. 
M:	We use the term ‘reflection.’

Q:	So if we truly understand this about our soul being unchanging, then when someone we love dies that we wouldn’t grieve?  Wouldn’t we still go thru an appropriate grieving process when someone dies?
A:	In the social life, grieving has a place. Janaka, who was an enlightened king, cried when Sita left with Rama. Otherwise he would not be in a society.

Q:	In regard to Pat’s question, it opens up the question that was described by St. Francis as the dark night of the soul. It’s another word for the grieving process. Isn’t there an expression in India, “There are no atheists in the cremation ground”? And, the title of the first chapter, Arjun Vishada Yoga, the Yoga of Arjuna’s Sorrow, his grieving. It has a valuable place in precipitating more insight into the process of knowing one’s true being.
M:	Pain is often the way that we find our way to the spiritual path.
Q:	Grieving is a kind of longing.
Q:	It’s a physiological process as well.
Q:	In America we say there are no atheists in the foxhole. 

Q:	Another component of the grieving process is many tears flowing. I remember when I was with Ramesh, a disciple of Nisargadatta, the question came up about Ramana Maharshi, a great enlightened sage. When one of his best friends passed away it appeared that he was crying, grieving. And the question arose, ‘How could he be crying?’ And so Ramesh said, “He was not weeping. Tears happened. Tears arose, a spontaneous happening.”
A:	It happened and also tears came.
Q:	An intensification of energy in one part of the body.
A:	There are eight signs.
M:	Signs of emotional turmoil, can also be signs of devotion.
A:	Ashta sattvic vikara. Eight sattvic faults.

Q:	I was wondering from the standpoint of the absolute, that only God is real and is the only thing that is real.
M:	Not completely pure. Could it be prarabdha karma as well, where something is still living in a human body and human emotions just pour forth.
A:	Prarabdha karma.
M:	Or we could be a teeny bit attached.
Q:	Chaitanya also used to cry. Was he exhibiting those vikara?
A:	(Nods yes.)
Q:	But that doesn’t bring enlightenment.
A:	It’s a process. Samadhi.

Q:	Could he have still continued those outward signs and movements until he left his body and still exhibited those devotional movements?
A:	Yes.

Q:	Can you tell us about the ground of the unknown and the unmanifest?
A:	Can’t explain it.
Q:	Somehow you’re not telling us the whole story. There should be some more practical entry into this and that Krishna’s not . . .
A:	We are in the first chapters. You will find it out. 

Q:	Also, there’s the Udhava Gita. That’s also . . . if even you don’t feel fulfilled at the end, there’s 24 chapters in the 11th book of the Srimad Bhagatavam. 
A:	All philosophies are the same, except the language is different. 
Q:	Or could you say, “It’s just philosophy?”
A:	In reading, it is philosophy. In actions, it is Karma Yoga.
Q:	Is there a point in studying philosophy, when the saying “ever learning and further from the truth” becomes appropriate?
A:	Philosophy is not a practicality.

Q:	The first person to call himself a philosopher was Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher who was also a God-realized saint and a direct descendant from Zeus, He chose his 10,000 disciples. He knew the past-lives of his disciples. He taught about the music of the spheres. 
A:	In India also, sages had disciples. That knowledge gets lost and then emerges.

Q:	Epictetus, and his student Marcus Aurelius. It’s said that people called him the philosopher king but he hought himself a poor student of philosophy. 
M:	He was a slave, but a bright kid. His mother’s master gave him a chance to be educated. Ultimately purchased by a Roman, went to Rome, and was freed. One of the great Stoic philosophers.
A:	Because philosophy is vast.
Q:	Epictetus was a cripple. He had only three possessions. He was freed because he was a good philosopher. He went into exile in Greece. A man with nothing, born a slave, cripple.  He used to say, “But have you ever seen me put on a sour face? No.”
M:	A man fool. 
A:	We create our bondage; we are born free.

Q:	In the life of Chaitanya, he was not interested in general Self-realization, but went from being a teacher himself of general topics in a regular school, to becoming a great devotee of Radha and Krishna. In the commentaries of Madhusudana Saraswati, they seem to accommodate this expression of divine love within the realm of the qualities of the absolute without it being perceived as a fault. Have you read those commentaries?
A:	Yes.
Q:	So it would seem there is a way, a perspective of the eight manifestations of ecstasy or when divine love was experienced, that would not necessarily need to be classified as a dosha or a fault. 
M:	It’s perhaps a matter of being a little dualistic.
Q:	Do we know that’s true? Does there need to be dualism to have the tears of Ramana Maharshi? How do we know there is the flaw of separation that’s expressed in these eight vikaras? Or perhaps, spontaneously tears happen.
A:	Because there is duality. 
Q:	There doesn’t have to be duality if there is a spontaneous outpouring of tears. Why does that need to be based on a cause and effect duality?
A:	Because emotions are triggered by devotion.
M:	So the absolute one is not going to sit there crying? “Why am I crying? What’s the matter with me? I’m having a little bit of a vikara.”

Q:	Swami Beyondananda is a spiritual comedian who speaks of the divine foolishness. He could be considered a modern-day philosopher of humor. One of his questions, “Have you tried so many spiritual paths that you’ve become pathological?” You could almost propose humor as another path to spirituality. Seriously, but not too seriously.
A:	One road is enough to reach the goal. Otherwise will be “beyond ananda.”
