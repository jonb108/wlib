These are the questions and answers with Baba Hari Dass at the Bhagavad Gita Class at the Pacific Cultural Center on Thursday, September 3, 2009. Amrit read the chalkboard. Reading: Bhagavad Gita XVIII: 65-68 (Moksha Sannyasa Yoga - Liberation Through Renunciation).

65 - Fix your mind on me; be devoted to me; sacrifice to me; bow down to me; you shall come even to me; truly do I promise to you (for) you are dear to me.

The Fruit of Karma Yoga - 66
66 - Abandoning all dharmas, take refuge in me alone; I will liberate you from all sins; grieve not.

The Rules that Should Be Followed While Imparting the Knowledge of the Gita to Others - 67
67 - This is never to be spoken by you to one who is devoid of austerities or devotion, nor to one who does not render service, or who desires not to listen, nor to one who cavils at me.

Rewards of Preaching the Secrets of the Gita among His Devotees – 68 & 69
68 - One who, with supreme devotion to me, will teach this supreme secret to my devotees shall doubtless come to me.

Q:	This expression of love, of the special bond between Krishna and Arjuna, I have a problem with that because I believe that Krishna loves each one of us equally.
A:	“I” represents the Self.

Q:	So when Krishna is speaking to Arjuna, he’s actually speaking to us.
Am:	Arjuna here is reaching the end of the journey. Krishna's saying, ‘You are now one with me.’ Anyone can achieve Arjuna’s state by devotion by God.

Q:	About individuality, in chapter 10 or 11, when Arjuna sees the cosmic form, the message is that ultimately you are going to end up in the same place, “my mouth.” But I was thinking about it differently. As an individual, what I have done or thought, it gets recorded into my mind. Anyone who can achieve a certain level of siddhi can access that and read anyone’s mind. If there is only one mind, where is our individually really, ultimately?
A:	There is one mind, but not one ego.
Q:	But you’ve said there’s no such thing as a universal ego. 
A:	The idea of asmi or I comes to create duality in mahat.
Am:	In Chapter 10, the analogy is why worry about these things? All will ultimately be consumed. 
Q:	Things get re-arranged, but an individual has a beginning and end, so it’s unreal. But the jiva is never born, never dies; it exists eternally. The difference between me and Babaji is that he has surrendered and I cannot. 
Q2:	Verse 68 is Babaji.
A:	Who surrenders? One who loses the battle. We all lose the battle if we say, “I did it.”

Q:	I always ponder about proselytizing and imparting the wisdom of the Gita. In Christianity there’s the expression, “Do not cast pearls before swine.” Where do we draw the line of discrimination in all this? Where does one decide if someone needs help or not, without proselytizing?
A:	What can you preach if you don’t practice?
Q:	So is it not appropriate for some people to even hear about the Gita?
A:	Anyone who realizes that he or she is in bondage qualifies.

Q:	If every single individual says, “I am,” isn’t that in a sense universal ego?
A:	“I” is universal ego.

Q:	Where Krishna says all beings enter into my mouth, wouldn’t that be comparable to the cosmic dreamer dreaming the universe, and that refers to dissolving the dream and all beings simply disappear?
A:	You got it!
Q:	Therefore could we not say that ultimately, the difference between Babaji and me is that I cannot surrender? Couldn’t it be said from the absolute standpoint, that it’s still the infinite expressing in a different way? As long as there is an I who has not surrendered, there’s still ego. Perhaps surrender simply happens.
A:	How do you define good and bad?
Q:	By whether there’s a beneficial or harmful impact on other beings or on the environment. 
A:	We all do. 
Q:	Everything’s a mixture of good and bad. Where there’s a predominance of sattva guna, we call it good.
A:	Guna means a rope of three strands. Sattva, rajas, tamas: the three gunas don’t work alone. 

Q2:	Surrender is not an ‘either you surrender or you don’t.’ When I said I cannot, it means I cannot surrender completely.
Q3:	The Bible says, ‘Knock and it shall be opened.’ That receptivity and humility is what opens you. 

Q:	Part of surrender is an emotional thing. 
A:	What is ‘Me’ in the verse? 
Q:	The divine, the infinite. 
A:	We can only say it is divine consciousness. Not bad if you do it!

Q:	It sounds like from what you’re saying that the Gita should be kept secret from some people. It sounds like some people would use it in an inappropriate way. 
A:	If you read the Gita and do not reflect on the teachings, you may understand it in a wrong way.
Q:	Some fundamental Christians read the Bible and misinterpret it and do wrong things. Is that what’s being referred to here?
A:	(Shakes head no.)
Q2:	The right gift at the right time in the right place.
Q:	What is the right time and who is the right person?
A:	When you have intense desire, then you are the right person.
Am:	Studying Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras also cautions in the same way.

Q:	When you were a young boy in school studying the Gita, how many of those boys were ready to receive the teachings?
A:	Some turned out bad; some are successful in the material world; some are dead.

Q:	About the love between Krishna and Arjuna: why is it so hard for Arjuna to recognize this love? 
A:	Because Arjuna was his friend from childhood. He could not see the divine essence in him. 

Q:	In Srimad Bhagavad , first canto, Krishna rushes toward Bhishma to kill him. Krishna’s love for Arjuna. Krishna pulled a chariot wheel and rushed toward Bhishma. 
Am:	Krishna put spells in front of him so he didn’t know what he was doing.
